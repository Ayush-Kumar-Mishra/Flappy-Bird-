This is a 2D Flappy Bird Game. 
Flappy Bird is an 2D arcade-style pc game in which the player controls a bird, which moves contineously to the right. The player is tasked with navigating bird through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Bird automatically falls down and only fly when the player taps space. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay.
